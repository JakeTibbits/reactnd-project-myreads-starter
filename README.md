# MyReads Project

Welcome to MyReads - the perfect way to keep track of every book you read in one place!

## Installation

If you haven't already, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) before getting started.

Then, simply run ```git clone https://github.com/JakeTibbits/reactnd-project-myreads-starter``` to copy this project into an empty directory.

Next, run ```cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter``` to navigate to the project directory, and ```npm install``` to unpack the project dependencies.

Finally, run ```npm start``` to get MyReads up and running in your browser!

## Tracking your reads

MyReads keeps your books organized on three handy shelves:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

On first loading the app you'll see that some books have been preloaded for you. To remove these, simply click on each book's green button and select 'none' from the Shelves options.

### Search Function

To add new books to your list, click the '+' icon in the lower right corner of the window and enter a search term. To add a book, just select the shelf you want to place it on from the dropdown.
